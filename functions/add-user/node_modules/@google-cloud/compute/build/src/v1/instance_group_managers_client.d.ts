     * in [this document](https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/main/client-libraries.md#creating-the-client-instance).
     * The common options are:
     * @param {object} [options.credentials] - Credentials object.
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.client_email]
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.private_key]
     * @param {string} [options.email] - Account email address. Required when
     *     using a .pem or .p12 keyFilename.
     * @param {string} [options.keyFilename] - Full path to the a .json, .pem, or
     *     .p12 key downloaded from the Google Developers Console. If you provide
     *     a path to a JSON file, the projectId option below is not necessary.

     *     the remote host.
     * @param {string} [options.projectId] - The project ID from the Google
     *     Developer's Console, e.g. 'grape-spaceship-123'. We will also check
     *     the environment variable GCLOUD_PROJECT for your project ID. If your

     * Flags the specified instances to be removed from the managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are applied by the managed instance group.

This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the status of the abandoning action with the listmanagedinstances method.

     * @param {string} request.requestId
     *   An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

     *   The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. It should conform to RFC1035.

     * @param {Object} request
     *   The request object that will be sent.
     * @param {string} request.filter
     *   A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`.
     * @param {boolean} request.includeAllScopes
     *   Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
     * @param {number} request.maxResults
     *   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
     * @param {string} request.orderBy
     *   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
     * @param {string} request.pageToken
     *   Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} request.project
     *   Project ID for this request.
     * @param {boolean} request.returnPartialSuccess
     *   Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
     * @param {object} [options]
     *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.
     * @returns {Object}
     *   An iterable Object that allows [async iteration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols).
     *   When you iterate the returned iterable, each element will be an object representing
     *   as tuple [string, {@link google.cloud.compute.v1.InstanceGroupManagersScopedList | InstanceGroupManagersScopedList}]. The API will be called under the hood as needed, once per the page,

     * @param {Object} request
     *   The request object that will be sent.
     * @param {string} request.filter
     *   A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`.
     * @param {string} request.instanceGroupManager
     *   The name of the managed instance group. It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long integer: must match regexp pattern: (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}.
     * @param {number} request.maxResults
     *   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
     * @param {string} request.orderBy
     *   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
     * @param {string} request.pageToken
     *   Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} request.project
     *   Project ID for this request.
     * @param {boolean} request.returnPartialSuccess

     * Lists all of the per-instance configurations defined for the managed instance group. The orderBy query parameter is not supported.
     *
     * @param {Object} request
     *   The request object that will be sent.
     * @param {string} request.filter
     *   A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`.
     * @param {string} request.instanceGroupManager
     *   The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035.
     * @param {number} request.maxResults
     *   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
     * @param {string} request.orderBy
     *   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
     * @param {string} request.pageToken
     *   Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} request.project
     *   Project ID for this request.
     * @param {boolean} request.returnPartialSuccess
     *   Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
     * @param {string} request.zone
     *   The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. It should conform to RFC1035.
     * @param {object} [options]
     *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.
     * @returns {Promise} - The promise which resolves to an array.
     *   The first element of the array is Array of {@link google.cloud.compute.v1.PerInstanceConfig | PerInstanceConfig}.
     *   The client library will perform auto-pagination by default: it will call the API as many
     *   times as needed and will merge results from all the pages into this array.
     *   Note that it can affect your quota.
     *   We recommend using `listPerInstanceConfigsAsync()`
     *   method described below for async iteration which you can stop as needed.
     *   Please see the
     *   [documentation](https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/master/client-libraries.md#auto-pagination)
