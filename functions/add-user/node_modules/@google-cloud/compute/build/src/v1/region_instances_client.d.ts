     * @param {object} [options] - The configuration object.
     * The options accepted by the constructor are described in detail
     * in [this document](https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/main/client-libraries.md#creating-the-client-instance).
     * The common options are:
     * @param {object} [options.credentials] - Credentials object.
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.client_email]
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.private_key]
     * @param {string} [options.email] - Account email address. Required when
     *     using a .pem or .p12 keyFilename.
     * @param {string} [options.keyFilename] - Full path to the a .json, .pem, or
     *     .p12 key downloaded from the Google Developers Console. If you provide
     *     a path to a JSON file, the projectId option below is not necessary.
     *     NOTE: .pem and .p12 require you to specify options.email as well.
     * @param {number} [options.port] - The port on which to connect to
     *     the remote host.
     * @param {string} [options.projectId] - The project ID from the Google
     *     Developer's Console, e.g. 'grape-spaceship-123'. We will also check
     *     the environment variable GCLOUD_PROJECT for your project ID. If your
     *     app is running in an environment which supports
     *     {@link https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials Application Default Credentials},
     *     your project ID will be detected automatically.
     * @param {string} [options.apiEndpoint] - The domain name of the
     *     API remote host.
     * @param {gax.ClientConfig} [options.clientConfig] - Client configuration override.
     *     Follows the structure of {@link gapicConfig}.
     * @param {boolean | "rest"} [options.fallback] - Use HTTP fallback mode.
     *     Pass "rest" to use HTTP/1.1 REST API instead of gRPC.
     *     For more information, please check the
     *     {@link https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/main/client-libraries.md#http11-rest-api-mode documentation}.

     *     need to avoid loading the default gRPC version and want to use the fallback
     *     HTTP implementation. Load only fallback version and pass it to the constructor:
     *     ```
     *     const gax = require('google-gax/build/src/fallback'); // avoids loading google-gax with gRPC
     *     const client = new RegionInstancesClient({fallback: 'rest'}, gax);

     * @param {string} request.requestId
     *   An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
     * @param {object} [options]
     *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.

     *   The first element of the array is an object representing
     *   a long running operation.
     *   Please see the
     *   [documentation](https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/master/client-libraries.md#long-running-operations)
     *   for more details and examples.
     *   This method is considered to be in beta. This means while
     *   stable it is still a work-in-progress and under active development,
     *   and might get backwards-incompatible changes at any time.
     *   `.promise()` is not supported yet.
